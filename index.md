# Think Tank for Startup Societies

enhanced by technologies like _artificial intelligence_ and _distributed ledger_,

based on modern concepts like _startup society_, _liquid democracy_, _universal basic income_, _network state_ and _digital identity_,

focused on how _technology_ can improve _social interactions_ and develop new digital societies that are _inclusive_, _equitable_, and _sustainable_.
