**Idea stream participation** refers to the act of contributing ideas or suggestions to a City Space's idea stream. This can take the form of writing short messages about an idea and sharing it with others in the space, or it could involve participating in discussions or voting on ideas that have been proposed by others.       
Idea stream is an important part of community or organization decision-making and problem-solving, as it allows individuals to share their thoughts and perspectives and contribute to the collective knowledge and resources of the space.      
It can also be a way for experts and other individuals to take an active role in shaping the direction and goals of the group, and to have a say in how problems are identified and addressed.

The process of identifying problems, research and solutions for future contexts requires a systematic and analytical approach that involves understanding the context, identifying and analyzing the problem, generating and evaluating potential solutions, and implementing and monitoring the chosen solution.      

This process of problem-solution proposals within the Digital Societies Institute, as a think tank, will make use of the tools developed within the CityOS.dev Framework for community participation and will consist in the following steps: 


1. Context Proposal
2. Problem Identification
2. Research
3. Solution Proposal
4. Solution Evaluation
