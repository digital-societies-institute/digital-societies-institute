title: Universal Basic Income Technology
---

Universal basic income (UBI) is a concept that has gained increasing attention in recent years. It refers to the idea of providing a guaranteed income to all members of a society, regardless of their employment status or other factors. This income would be sufficient to cover the basic needs of an individual, such as food, shelter, and healthcare, and it would be provided on an ongoing basis.

One of the key challenges of implementing a universal basic income is the issue of how to distribute the funds. In a society with millions or billions of individuals, it would be impractical and inefficient to distribute payments manually. This is where technology comes in.

UBI can be seen as a part of a larger concept of an universal rewarding system, in which individuals are provided with rewards or incentives for various activities or contributions. This system would go beyond just providing income, and it could include a variety of rewards or incentives that recognize and support different types of contributions.

At the Digital Societies Institute, we are exploring the best approaches for using technology to support universal basic income. One of the options we are considering is directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology. Unlike traditional blockchain, which uses a linear structure to record transactions, DAG uses a web-like structure that allows for faster and more efficient transaction processing. This makes it well-suited for handling the large volume of transactions that would be required for universal basic income payments.

In addition to DAG, we are also looking at the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to support universal basic income. AI algorithms could be used to automatically calculate the appropriate amount for each individual based on their basic needs. This would help to ensure that payments are distributed accurately and efficiently, without the need for manual intervention.

Overall, technology has the potential to play a crucial role in the implementation of universal basic income. At the Digital Societies Institute, we are committed to exploring and advancing the use of technology to support this important concept. By using DAG and AI, we can help to make universal basic income a reality sooner rather than later.
