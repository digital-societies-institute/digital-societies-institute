One of the key areas that the Institute is interested in is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support better community participation and collaboration. 
AI has the potential to enable digital communities to function more effectively and efficiently, by automating certain tasks and processes, and by providing support and assistance to community members.     


Some examples of AI tools and solutions that the Digital Societies Institute is exploring include:

1.    AI-powered collaboration tools that can help individuals and groups to work together more effectively, by providing suggestions, recommendations, and support.

1.    AI-powered decision-making tools that can assist digital communities in making collective decisions, by providing data, analysis, and insights.

1.    AI-powered moderation tools that can help to manage and regulate online discussions and debates within a digital community.

1.    AI-powered personal assistants that can provide support and assistance to community members, by answering questions, providing information, and helping to resolve problems.

1.    AI-powered recommendation and discovery tools that can help community members to find and access relevant information, resources, and opportunities within the community.
