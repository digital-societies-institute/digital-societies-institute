title: Digital City Operating System
---

[**CityOS**](https://cityos.dev){:target=_blank} is our exciting project to develop an operating system for digital societies.   
This operating system will be designed to support the unique needs and challenges of modern communities, and will provide a framework for social interaction and collaboration among individuals and organizations. 

Our goal is to create a system that is scalable, flexible, and user-friendly, and that can be customized to meet the specific needs of different communities. 

The operating system will be built using the latest technologies and will be constantly updated and improved based on user feedback and evolving needs. 

We believe that this operating system has the potential to revolutionize the way that we interact and live in the digital age, and we are eager to work with researchers, industry professionals, and community members to make this vision a reality.

So, this framework enables urban communities and organizations to build digital spaces for their social interactions and digital assets.

CityOS empower the transition from “social media” to “social spaces”.

It implements concepts and ideas elaborated by the [Digital Societies Institute](https://digital.societies.institute){:target=_blank} and represents the technology base for the [IM.CITY](https://IM.CITY){:target=_blank} and [UR.CITY](https://UR.CITY){:target=_blank} platforms.
