# Fixing Privacy: Unique Identity vs. Contextual Identity


**The concept of identity is a human construct, and it is time for a significant shift in how we think about it.**

In the universe, interactions occur between entities that are not defined by their identity.
Despite the fact that the universe does not care about identity, humans still need a form of identification because our lives are shaped by interactions with three types of entities: *objects*, *people*, *technology*. 

In order to authorize or track these interactions, we need some way of identifying ourselves and the entities we interact with.   

**Still, the need for this identification is a fundamental part of our existence as humans.**



## When do we need identification?

----------

### Interaction with objects

When interacting with objects, our identity is not relevant. The laws of physics apply regardless of who we are.      
These objects do not care about our identity and will follow the laws of physics regardless.

### Interaction with people

When interacting with other people, our identity becomes more important. In most cases, we need to identify ourselves in order to establish trust and facilitate communication.    
Knowing "who are you?" is often crucial in these interactions, as it helps to determine how we should relate to one another.    
This is why identification is typically necessary when interacting with other people.


### Interaction with technology

When it comes to technology, the situation is more complex.    

The *"thing"* part of technology, such as the physical components of a computer, follows the laws of physics and does not require our identification.     
However, the *"intelligent"* part of technology, which is programmed by humans, follows human laws of identification.    
This means that in order to interact with certain aspects of technology, such as the intelligent functions of a computer, we might need to identify ourselves.   
This is because these intelligent functions are designed and programmed by humans, who have a different scope for identification and authorization.


&nbsp;

## The Past — Unique Identity

----------
&nbsp;

As a result of their need for identification, humans have developed a complex and strict system of identification.    

This system is based on the concept of a **"unique identity"** – the idea that a person can only be one specific person.     

In order to establish and verify this unique identity, humans have implemented various **"unique ID elements"** such as *names*, *photos*, and *fingerprints*. These elements are used to confirm the uniqueness of a person's identity.   

As **artificial intelligence** becomes more advanced, it is possible that this will change. AI may be able to design and program technology in a way that does not require a human approach to identity.   
This could be because AI has a different perspective on **contextual details**, or because it is able to learn and adapt to different approaches to identity. It is not clear exactly how this will play out, but we can be sure that the way we think about identity in relation to technology will change in the future.


### The trouble with unique identity
&nbsp;


**The uniqueness of a person's identity means that it can be reused in different contexts. This means that the identification elements we use in one situation can potentially be used in other contexts, sometimes in a fraudulent manner. Because of this, increased strictness and complexity in the current system of identification is necessary in order to prevent fraudulent use of someone's identity.**


There are two solutions to the privacy problems caused by our current approach to identification:

1. **Get rid of identification.** Whenever possible, interactions should be carried out without the need for identification. For example, we should be able to pay for an apple at the market without needing to identify ourselves. This is the natural way of interacting, but it is not always used. Businesses and governments often require identification unnecessarily. This situation is starting to be regulated by lawmakers, such as the EU-GPDR.


2. **Use contextual identity.** When it is not possible to carry out an interaction without identification, the identification process should use **"contextual identity" instead of "unique identity"**. This means that the identification elements used should be specific to the context in which the interaction is taking place, rather than being the same in all situations.


## The Future — Contextual Identity

----------
&nbsp;

>**"Contextual identity"** refers to the use of different identifiers for an "entity" (such as a person, object, or virtual asset) depending on the context. This approach does not allow for the complete identification of the entity, but still allows the receiver to complete the authorization process as needed. In other words, contextual identity allows for partial identification that is specific to the context in which the interaction is taking place. This can help to protect privacy while still enabling authorized interactions.

The main advantage of using contextual identities is that it allows for the isolation of different contexts from one another. This means that a receiver who receives identifying information in one context will not be able to use the same information in another context. **This helps to protect privacy** by ensuring that identifying information cannot be easily shared or transferred between different contexts. By using contextual identities, it is possible to provide just enough information for a specific interaction, without revealing more than is necessary. This can help to prevent unauthorized access and prevents the reuse of unique ID elements and helps to protect the privacy of the entity being identified preventing identity-related fraud.

One way to understand the concept of "contextual identities" is to **think of it in terms of credit cards**. For example, with the same bank account, we may use a different credit card number for each merchant. This means that if someone were to "steal" our credit card number from one merchant, they would not be able to use it to steal our money from other merchants. In this way, the use of different credit card numbers for different contexts helps to protect our financial information and prevent fraud. Similarly, the use of contextual identities for other types of interactions can help to protect our personal information and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

==

In a basic way, we use contextual identities naturally in **our everyday lives**. For example, we may be known by our first name by our colleagues at work, by a nickname by our close friends, and by our last name when dealing with officials. These are different contextual identities that we use depending on the context and the people we are interacting with. In this way, we are able to provide just enough information to enable the interaction, without revealing more than is necessary. This helps to protect our personal information and prevent unauthorized access or misuse of our identity.

==

Another example of the use of contextual identities can be seen in the **use of barcode tickets**. When you buy access to a theater performance, for example, a ticket is issued with an identification number, typically in the form of a barcode. This barcode serves as your identification for the specific context of attending that performance on a particular evening, at a specific theater, for a specific play, and even for a specific seat within the theater. In this way, the barcode on the ticket serves as your "contextual identity" for the purpose of accessing the performance. This allows the theater to confirm your identity and grant you access without needing to collect and store more personal information than is necessary.

In some cases, **governments may use a form of contextual identification** that is different from contextual identity. For example, many countries issue "contextual ID documents" such as driving licenses. In some cases, such as in many English-speaking countries, there may not be a centralized unique ID document. There may also be specialized "proof of age" documents that are used by young people to purchase alcohol.

While these documents may serve as contextual ID in certain situations, they still hold the individual's unique identity, and the document itself serves as proof of authorization for that unique identity. This is different from a true contextual identity, which would use different identifying elements depending on the context. The use of contextual ID documents by governments can still help to protect privacy and prevent identity fraud, but it is not the same as using contextual identities.

## Conclusion

----------------
&nbsp;


**It will be the task of new technology to implement the concept of contextual identity at the root level of our interactions.**    
This will require the development of new systems and technologies that are able to generate, manage, and verify contextual identities in a way that is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. By integrating contextual identity into the core of our interactions, we will be able to protect our privacy and prevent unauthorized access to our personal information.   
**This will be particularly important as we continue to rely on technology for an increasingly large portion of our daily activities.**


In order to properly implement the concept of contextual identity, new blockchain and tangle protocols may be needed. Blockchain technology, which uses a distributed ledger to store and verify transactions, has the potential to enable the secure and efficient management of contextual identities. Tangle protocols, such as IOTA, may be an even better fit for this purpose, as they are designed to support the secure and efficient transfer of value without the need for a central authority. By leveraging the capabilities of these new technologies, it may be possible to implement contextual identity at a large scale, enabling the secure and privacy-preserving management of personal information.
