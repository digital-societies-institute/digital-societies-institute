# A new approach on connected contexts

## The Interactions

----------------

The basic component of both our daily lives and the universe as a whole is **"interaction"**.      
Interactions between entities, whether they be people, objects, or technology, are the fundamental building blocks of our experiences and the way the universe functions. By understanding the nature and importance of interaction, we can gain insight into the complex systems that shape our world and our lives.


We interact with everything outside our body, as well as with ourselves, through the workings of our brains and other internal organs. The brain, in particular, is capable of creating an entire world inside of our minds, full of interactions and experiences. This inner world allows us to think, imagine, and dream, and it is an essential part of who we are as human beings. 


The context in which an interaction takes place is determined by the amount of information or details that are known about the entities involved. When one or more of these details change, a new context is formed. Interactions between entities can cause changes in context, either by adding new information or by altering existing information. 

While the universe is infinite and the context in which interactions take place may have an infinite number of details, only a finite number of these details are typically affected by a single interaction. Therefore, the context of an interaction can be understood by considering only the details that are involved in that interaction, or "the context frame". This limited number of details can help to simplify our understanding of the context and make it easier to analyze and predict the outcomes of interactions. By focusing on the context frame, we can gain insight into the specific factors that shape the way interactions unfold and the effects they have.

The infinite context of the universe continues to exist and operate, we as humans are unable to consider all the details of this context simultaneously. In order to make decisions and engage in interactions effectively, we must focus on a limited number of details, or "context frames". This allows us to operate within a finite context that we can understand and manipulate. While the infinite context continues to exist and influence our actions, we are able to make informed decisions and engage in meaningful interactions by considering only a subset of the details that make up the full context.

The primary difference between the infinite context of the universe and the finite contexts that we use to make decisions and engage in interactions is that the former includes all of the latter. The infinite context is all-encompassing and contains within it an infinite number of finite contexts. By considering only a limited number of details, we are able to create and operate within a finite context that is a subset of the full, infinite context. While the infinite context continues to exist and influence our actions, we are able to focus on the specific details that are relevant to a given situation and make informed decisions based on that limited context.

Finite contexts often share details, which means that a change in one context may also affect other contexts that include the same detail. For example, if we consider the context of a specific interaction between two people, that context may include details such as the location, the time of day, and the specific individuals involved. If the location of the interaction changes, the context of the interaction will also change, and any other contexts that include the same location detail will be affected as well. This interconnectedness of contexts means that a change in one context can have far-reaching effects and can lead to the creation of new contexts. By understanding the ways in which contexts intersect and influence one another, we can better anticipate the potential consequences of our actions and make more informed decisions.


## Infinite Context = Network of Finite Contexts

----------------


The infinite context of the universe can be thought of as the network of all possible finite contexts. Each individual finite context is a subset of the full, infinite context, and all of the finite contexts are interconnected and can influence one another. This network of contexts allows for an almost infinite number of possible interactions and outcomes, as the details of each context can change and lead to new contexts being created. By understanding the ways in which finite contexts intersect and influence one another within the larger network of the infinite context, we can gain insight into the complex systems that shape our world and our experiences.

As technology continues to evolve and become more advanced, it is important that it be able to effectively manage interactions and the contexts in which they take place. By understanding the role that context plays in shaping interactions, technology can be designed to anticipate and adapt to changes in context, and to facilitate more effective and efficient interactions. This may require the development of new algorithms and approaches that can take into account the complex network of contexts that exists within the universe, and that can help to optimize interactions and outcomes based on the specific details of each context. As technology continues to advance, it will play an increasingly important role in managing interactions and their contexts, and in shaping the world around us.

**That way, a new Internet is formed: “The Internet of Contexts**

The integration of technology with the understanding of context has the potential to give rise to a new kind of internet, one that is based on the network of contexts that exist within the universe. This "Internet of Contexts" would allow for the creation of new and innovative services and applications that are able to take into account the details of specific contexts, and that can adapt and evolve as those contexts change. By leveraging the power of technology to manage and analyze the complex network of contexts that exists within the universe, we can unlock new opportunities for innovation and growth, and pave the way for a new era of interconnectedness and collaboration.

As individuals, we are not the center of the universe, and our actions and interactions are only a small part of the larger network of contexts that exists within the universe. While we may be an important part of many of the interactions that take place around us, we are ultimately just one of the many details that make up the full context of the universe. This means that our actions and interactions are not the sole determinant of the outcomes of those interactions, and that we must be aware of and take into account the many other factors that shape the contexts in which we operate. By recognizing that we are part of a larger whole, we can better understand our place in the world and the ways in which our actions and interactions contribute to the overall network of contexts that exists within the universe.

While humans have the ability to influence a large number of contextual details through our intelligence and will, it is important to recognize that the total number of contextual details is essentially infinite. This means that even the most significant actions taken by humans are likely to affect only a small fraction of the total number of contextual details, and that our impact on the broader network of contexts is relatively insignificant. This does not diminish the importance of human action, but rather serves as a reminder that we are part of a larger whole, and that our actions must be considered in the context of the broader network of contexts that exists within the universe. By understanding our place within this larger network, we can make more informed decisions and better understand the ways in which our actions and interactions can shape the world around us.
